# just the spot

This is my final project for the FlatIron Web Developer immersive program. I created it because I find that when I am meeting up with friends, we go to the same spots even though we live in New York City, which has so much to offer. The site helps identify new places to check out and also helps uncover things you never knew you wanted!

Some technical notes:
- used Ruby on Rails, SQL, and PostGres for the backend and Javascript (React and Redux) for the frontend.
- used Nokogiri to scrape GrubStreet's "Absolute Best of New York" blogs
- All CSS/HTML is custom
- Homescreen art is Roy Lichtenstein's "Frightened Girl (1964)"
